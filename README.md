# Quiz_Game

> ### This is a quiz game made for a college project about world cups. the game now has its main functions, that means it is now playable but not fully completed.

## What to expect to create with this project:

- Create a mini quiz about world cups, something close to 15 to 20 questions with easy and hard difficulty levels;
- The user can log in as a player or as an administrator, each with their activities;
- There will also be a ranking to track the performance of players, creating some kind of competition.

### NOTE:

- Before playing on your pc, change the path to this directory within the code, otherwise the program will not work as it should.
- The files that require changes are: **Ranking_Functions.py** and **__init__.py**, at the bottom of each file. Both are inside the Functions directory.
